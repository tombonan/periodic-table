# Periodic Table Application

A simple application that displays the periodic table of elements and highlights the characteristics of a selected element. The app was built using React and create-react-app with a custom css grid that I designed to display the elements as you would find on a normal periodic table.

## Running Locally
To run this app locally, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer. Then just clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run!

```
git clone https://github.com/tombonan/periodic-table.git && cd periodic-table
npm install
npm start
```

## Live demo
A live demo of the app is deployed to Heroku and can be [viewed here](https://nameless-ravine-55497.herokuapp.com/)
